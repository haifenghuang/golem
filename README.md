# The Golem Programming Language

**Golem is a fledgling project right now.  Its not yet ready for production use.**  

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted language, with first-class functions and a 
dynamic type system.  Golem aims to combine the clean semantics of Python, 
the concurrency of Go, the flexibility of Javascript, and the embeddability of Lua.
