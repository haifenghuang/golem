# The Golem Programming Language

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted language, with first-class functions and a 
dynamic type system.  Golem aims to combine the clean semantics of Python, 
the concurrency of Go, and the flexibility of Javascript.

Golem is an embryonic project right now -- its not even close to being useful yet.
